Include only records where non-paying customers have more downloads than paying customers.

DataFrames: ms_user_dimension, ms_acc_dimension, ms_download_facts

df_user = ms_user_dimension.merge(ms_acc_dimension, on='acc_id')
df_all = df_user.merge(ms_download_facts, on='user_id')

df_all['unpaid'] = df_all['downloads']

df_all.loc[df_all['paying_customer']=='no','paid'] = 0
df_all.loc[df_all['paying_customer']=='yes','unpaid'] = 0

daily_values = df_all.groupby('date').sum().reset_index()[['date','paid','unpaid']]

final_result = daily_values[daily_values['paid'] < daily_values['unpaid']]
